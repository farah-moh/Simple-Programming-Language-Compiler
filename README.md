# Simple Programming Language Compiler (Based On C++)

### How to run?

run the following command in the terminal on windows or you can just open the run.bat file from the file explorer:

```
./run.bat
```

to run the GUI version of the compiler you need to run the following command in the terminal on windows or you can just open the GUI.bat file from the file explorer:

```
./GUI.bat
```

For linux you need to run the same commands in the run.bat file commands manually.

All extra testcases are in the testcases folder. It is advised to run the GUI version of the compiler to see the output of the testcases, possible errors and the generated code.
